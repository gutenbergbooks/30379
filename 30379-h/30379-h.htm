<h1><span class="sp1">FIELD TRIP</span></h1>

<h2>By Gene Hunter</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Kial</span> was disgusted with the
slow, cumbersome train. He
disliked using this uncomfortable
means of travel, but since he wanted
to learn more about these
strange creatures who were his ancestors,
he had decided to try to become
used to their ways.</p>

<p>He was lonely in this strange,
backward age and when he unexpectedly
saw another being like
himself in the same coach, he hastened
to make his presence known.
He introduced himself and asked
politely:</p>

<p>"When are <i>you</i> from?"</p>

<p>"8000," the other replied.
"Name's Broyk, from VII Galaxy."</p>

<p>"I'm from out XIX way myself,"
Kial said. "Just a country
boy. But 8000&mdash;that's only a period
ahead of my own time. Maybe you
could tell me ..."</p>

<p>"Ah, ah!" the other admonished.
"Remember the First Law of
Thek!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Center," Kial grumbled.
"I know: 'One may not divulge
any scientific, technical or social information
to anyone from his own
past whom he may meet at an
equidistant point in a Thek-travel.'
I forgot."</p>

<p>"Bad," Broyk said. Then he added,
almost jokingly: "You wouldn't
want to be marooned in this dismal
era, would you?"</p>

<p>Kial shuddered. "Of course not.
But the Laws seem so ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," Broyk said, warming
up to the subject. "It's very
simple, really. Same principle that
doesn't allow anyone to Thek-travel
into the future.</p>

<p>"Look. I'm from 8000. Say that
I went into 12,000, where I memorized
as much information as I
could on some subject such as
medicine. So I return to 8000, retaining
all such knowledge in my
mind that's been learned in four
periods. Therefore, I'd have knowledge
that wasn't dreamed of in my
own time, but was discovered sometime
during the next four periods.
But then it couldn't be discovered,
because I'd brought it back to 8000
and&mdash;well, I'm no Logician, but
you see my point."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's reasonable, I suppose,"
Kial admitted. "I realize the Laws
are really for our own good. By the
way&mdash;I'm here on a field trip to
gather material for my thesis on
Advanced Therapeutical Psychology
and its development since the
Twentieth Century. What phase of
this era are you here to study?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid I couldn't tell
you that," Broyk said. "It's of rather
a secret nature and ..."</p>

<p>"You mean we might violate a
Law and be stuck here for good&mdash;is
that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in a way."</p>

<p>Frightened, Kial let the matter
drop. His gaze wandered through
the coach, examining the other
passengers with interest. As time-travelers
from a different space-time
plane from their 20th Century
ancestors, he and Broyk were naturally
invisible to their fellow travelers.</p>

<p>Two pompous old gentlemen
were lighting cigars and Kial was
about to remark on the habit of
smoking when he noticed an even
more remarkable phenomenon. A
few seats ahead of them sat a good-looking
young couple, oblivious to
others about them.</p>

<p>"Look!" Kial cried excitedly.
"Lovers! Honeymooners! I've read
about such things! Isn't it disgusting?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," Broyk said,
a little wistfully. "I sometimes
think it was a mistake for Center to
do away with sex. It must have
been interesting."</p>

<p>"Atavist!" Kial snapped in horror.</p>

<p>Had his people's emotional
make-up provided for blushing,
Kial would undoubtedly have
turned beet-red. Broyk's words had
caused him acute embarrassment.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As</span> he sat reflecting upon his
strange companion, he suddenly
began to feel a sensation he
had often heard about but never
before had experienced. Terror
and dismay filled him as he sought
to throw off the probing finger that
was penetrating his mind.</p>

<p>He looked at Broyk. There was
the faintest notion of a smile on
the other's face as he said: "Yes,
Kial&mdash;I am a Telepath."</p>

<p>Kial's mind reeled. He felt himself
on the brink of some gigantic
abyss and then, as suddenly as it
had come, the searching sensation
faded away.</p>

<p>"Since you are unable to enter
my mind," Broyk said calmly, "it's
only fair that I tell you about myself.
You were right&mdash;I'm an atavist.
Even in period 8000, such
things can happen. Always such
creatures are destroyed after their
first psychotests, but my case was
different. The Controller who bred
me was only a dabbler in such
things. I was a failure, but he took
a fancy to me. I was allowed to
mature secretly&mdash;few people knew
of my existence. When I reached
my majority my presence became
dangerous and I was sent back into
time to try and find the proper
place for myself. And I think I've
found it&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>Kial was a very amazed young
man. "But such a barbarous age,"
he complained. "Sex and atom
bombs and everything ..."</p>

<p>"Remember," Broyk smiled,
"these people are the forebears of
the geniuses who created Center
and the Galactic Empire. They'll
survive, despite their barbarism.
The existence of Center is proof."</p>

<p>"It's rather horrible to contemplate,"
Kial said thoughtfully,
calmer now, "and yet, this might
really be a great age. In a way I
almost envy you."</p>

<p>"Of course you do," Broyk said.
"You have certain tendencies&mdash;they
bother you, although you
manage to hide them well. I discovered
them when I took the liberty
of telepathing you. Artificial
Genetics isn't perfect, even in our
time&mdash;perhaps because we originally
sprang from man. Perhaps
we'll never be quite perfect, because
of that, even after thousands
of periods of breeding."</p>

<p>Kial took another look at the
loving young couple. "It&mdash;it might
be fun, after all."</p>

<p>Broyk laughed. "You needn't envy
me at all, you know."</p>

<p>Kial frowned.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you about myself,"
Broyk went on, "I have also told
you of a specific condition existing
a period ahead of your own time.
Remember the First Law?"</p>

<p>"Center!"</p>

<p>"We're marooned in the Twentieth
Century. You have to accept
it."</p>

<p>"But what will we <i>do</i>?" Kial's
mind was reeling again.</p>

<p>"Since we've already broken the
First Law," Broyk said, "we may
just as well break the Second: 'No
Thek-traveler may enter the body
of a native of a foreign space-time ...'"</p>

<hr />

<p>The young lovers kissed again
and this time there seemed to be
an added zest, even to their passionate
embrace.</p>
